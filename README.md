Welcome to the peak fitting tool **Peak Performance** using a Bayesian approach to fit data peaks from targeted LC-MS/MS analyses, yielding probability distributions for key parameters such as the peak area. The astute reader will have noticed that this introduces uncertainty quantification for every single analyzed peak, thus enabling (and necessitating) error propagation in subsequent calculations and thus a more realistic interpretation and presentation of experimental data. Because as per our adage...
